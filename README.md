# Projects
Hey there! Thanks for dropping by my Github page. Below you'll find a collection of the recent projects I've been working on and have been able to make publicly available. I have a few more in the works but they aren't quite ready to share. Many of these projects have been used in a variety of presentations and webinars for Datadog. Some are just for fun and personal experimentation.
