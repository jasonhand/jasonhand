# Projects
Hey there! Thanks for dropping by my Github page. Below you'll find a collection of the recent projects I've been working on and have been able to make publicly available. I have a few more in the works but they aren't quite ready to share. Many of these projects have been used in a variety of presentations and webinars for Datadog. Some are just for fun and personal experimentation. 

## What's What
1. Generative Debrief - An app written to demonstrate using OpenAI with Azure Logic Apps and Datadog for a webinar taking place on May 14th, 2024
2. Doggo Explorer - An app written to demonstrate using Datadog's Real User Monitoring (RUM) as part of an on-stage demo during my presentation at Google Cloud Next '24
3. Video Tools - A command line app written to assist in video, audio, and transcription needs I've had while working on various projects at Datadog
4. Vinyl Viewer - An app written to visualize my vinyl record collection including Spotify integrations to listen to clips from the the record
5. Ignite Karaoke - An app written to play "Ignite Karaoke" with the Datadog Advocacy team during one of our off-site meetings
