# My Workstation Setup

## Primary Device
- Macbook M1 (14-inch, 2021) on a
- Riser stand

## Video

- Camera (Sony 5100 - used) with micro HDMI out to a
- HDMI Converter with HDMI in (from the camera) and USB (to a USB dongle plugged directly into one of my Macbook's USB-C ports)
- Camera stand that clamps to the desk behind my monitors, so it adjusts with the standing desk height.
- Large Ring Light with weighted base
- Small Ring Light that clamps to the back of the desk
- Rear Light on it's own tripod
- Desktop Light to even out shadows on face

## Audio

- Shure SM7B microphone on a
- Pyle weighted free standing base (kick drum mic stand) allowing me to move it around or of my desk completely. No arm to mess with. It also fits perfectly between my split keyboard. 
- XLR microphone cable from SM7B to DM1 Dynamite Boomstick to boost the signal from the microphone into the
- Focusrite Scarlett 6i6 which connects to the same USB dongle mentioned above. This device handles all audio to the Macbook. You can also send a signal out and control the volume for
- Sony MDR-7506 Dynamic Stereo Headphones which are very clear across the entire audio spectrum and comfortable to wear for long periods

## Peripherals

- Standing Desk
- Standing Pad
- Chair that is comfortable to sit in with a lot of adjustments and can be moved out of the way to stand
- Keyboard is a mechanical split keyboard for the ergonomics, comfort, effeciency, and convenience with the way I like to setup my microphone. It also includes a
- Custom Datadog key cap connected where my Escape key was before
- Wired gaming mouse. I've used many mice over the years and have concluded that a wired (laser) mouse is always more reliable, accurate, and maintenance free. 
- CalDigit perepheral hub (like a docking station). My mouse and keyboard are plugged into this hub as well as my
- Stream Deck which provides quick access to a lot of tasks including taking screenshots, accessing Datadog apps I use regularly, and navigating Spotify to name a few
- 2 AOC monitors
